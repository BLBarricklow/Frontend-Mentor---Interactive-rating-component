## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript interactability
### What I learned

This challenge primarily re-enforced layout concepts and basic javascript state switching. One main thing to remember is the need to have some html elements touching in order to remove whitespace between them, in this case between the radio buttone and their labels. I also learned more about how to use a browsers devtools to ensure color accuracy and spacing of elements.

### Continued development

I need to continue improving my CSS understanding. Focusing on more simple and fluid spacing of elements. I also want to get better at using clamp. I also need to build a better understanding of aria roles and labels.
